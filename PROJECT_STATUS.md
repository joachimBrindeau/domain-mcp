| **Total** | **106** | **✅ 100%** | All Dynadot API actions implemented |

## Test Coverage

| Type | Tests | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| End-to-End Tests | 106 | ✅ Complete |
| Functional Tests | 26 | ✅ Complete |
| Unit Tests | - | ⚠️ Not implemented |
| Integration Tests | - | ⚠️ Not implemented |
| Coverage Threshold | 80% | ✅ Configured |

**Note:** Functional tests cover real API CRUD operations. Unit tests are not critical given the test coverage but could be added.

### 🚧 In Progress

None - All planned features implemented!

### 💡 Future Enhancements

These are nice-to-have features that could be added:

- [ ] npm package publishing
- [ ] Unit test coverage for client.ts
- [ ] Rate limiting/request queuing (Dynadot allows 1 concurrent request)
- [ ] Response caching for read operations
- [ ] Webhook support (if Dynadot adds it)
- [ ] Domain monitoring/alerts
- [ ] Bulk operations helper
- [ ] Interactive CLI tool
- [ ] Web UI dashboard
- [ ] Docker image
- [ ] Homebrew formula
- [ ] VS Code extension

### ❌ Out of Scope

These won't be implemented:

- Alternative registrar support (Dynadot only)
- Database persistence (stateless by design)
- Built-in scheduling (use external tools)
- Email notifications (use external services)

## MCP Client Support

| Client | Status | Tested | Notes |
|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Claude Code | ✅ Supported | ✅ | Full documentation provided |
| Cursor | ✅ Supported | ✅ | Full documentation provided |
| Claude Desktop | ✅ Supported | ✅ | Full documentation provided |
| Other MCP Clients | ✅ Supported | ⚠️ | Should work with any MCP-compliant client |

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| macOS | ✅ Tested | Primary development platform |
| Linux | ✅ Supported | Should work, not extensively tested |
| Windows | ✅ Supported | Should work, not extensively tested |
| Docker | ⚠️ Not packaged | Could be added in future |

## Node.js Support

| Version | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| 18.x | ✅ Supported | Minimum required version |
| 20.x | ✅ Supported | Recommended |
| 22.x | ✅ Supported | Latest LTS |
| 16.x and below | ❌ Not supported | Too old |

## Known Limitations

### Dynadot API Limitations

1. **Contact Editing**: Requires ALL fields, not just changed ones
2. **Domain Unlocking**: May fail due to domain protection settings (API limitation)
3. **Rate Limiting**: Only 1 concurrent request allowed (implemented retry logic)
4. **API Key Scope**: Full account access, no read-only keys available

### Project Limitations

1. **No Unit Tests**: Functional tests provide good coverage, unit tests optional
2. **No Response Caching**: Every request hits the API (intentional for data freshness)
3. **No Request Queuing**: Relies on retry logic for rate limiting
4. **Stateless Design**: No database, no persistent state
